# Heart-Disease
This project focuses on the construction of an artificial intelligence-based heart disease detection system using machine learning algorithms. I show how machine learning can help predict whether a person will develop heart disease. In this paper, a python-based application is developed for healthcare research as it is more reliable and helps track and establish different types of health monitoring applications. I present data processing that entails working with categorical variables and conversion of categorical columns. I describe the main phases of application developments: collecting databases, performing logistic regression, and evaluating the dataset’s attributes. A random forest classifier algorithm is developed to identify heart diseases with higher accuracy. Data analysis is needed for this application, which is considered significant according to its approximately 81% accuracy rate over training data. We then discuss the random forest classifier algorithm, including the experiments and the results, which provide better accuracies for research diagnoses. We conclude the paper with objectives, limitations and research contributions.

1. Introduction

Heart diseases are often used in exchange for cardiovascular diseases. These kinds of diseases mainly refer to the conditions of blocked or narrowed blood vessels, resulting in a stroke, chest pain or angina, and heart attack. Other kinds of heart conditions, such as those affecting the rhythm, valve, or muscle of the heart, are other types of heart diseases. On the other hand, machine learning is crucial for determining whether anyone has suffered from heart disease. In either case, if these are predicted ahead of time, doctors would have a much easier time gaining crucial information for treating and diagnosing patients. Heart disease is mainly an incorrect symptom of coronary artery disease. It is also known as a cardiac disease; therefore, it is not with cardiovascular disease, which is any blood vessel disease.
Python is a programming language with a high level of object-oriented abstraction with a spirited, energetic collection of building options and quick development cycles. As per Loku et al. [1] analysis, it is regarded as one of the safest programming languages with numerous applications in the medical field. Furthermore, it is regarded as a well-liked and well-accepted programming language with applications traversing over AI-based software developments and several other web applications. As per the suggestion of Mathur [2], the python framework is used easily for creating a desktop or web-based application. As per the depiction of Guleria and Sood [3], with the application of python programming in the health care sectors, especially for detecting heart diseases, clinicians and institutions can provide better and improvised outcomes for the patients through scalable and dynamic applications. However, the coding packages and libraries used in this project are Pandas, Matplotlib, IPython, Numpy, Python, SciPy, and many others.
